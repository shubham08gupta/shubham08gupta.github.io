Check out my profile at [https://shubham08gupta.github.io/]


Developed on top of [https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv] using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## How to make your own profile?

1. Clone this project.
2. Edit `data.yml` file.
3. Create a new repository like yourgithubname/yourgithubname.github.io. For eg: my github id is shubham08gupta. So I created a new repository with a name as shubham08gupta/`shubham08gupta.github.io`.
4. [Optional] create a branch called `gh-pages`.
5. Push the code in your created repository. If you've created a `gh-pages` branch, check the repository settings page and select `gh-pages` branch.
6. Check your brand new site at http://yourgithubname.github.io/. It may take a several minutes to generate the site.
